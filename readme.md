Hi my name is Nadyah and I've taken a lot of computer science courses, here are some of my projects.

## Robocode Journal

(5/27/24):
Starter code done. I also started to formulate my strategy of using random numbers for the directions. My idea is that if movement with patterns is predictable, then I'll make the movement of my robot unprodictable. I wrote my code for the random varables. I also created some of my main movements and input the random variables into how far ahead or back the robot goes. I still couldn't beat any of the bots besides sitting duck though. 

(5/28/24):
Initial Commit done because I wasn't sure how to commit changes the night before. I decided to make the direction the robot goes in random as well. In class I tried to make the gun better and I commited that change too. I also made my robot blue. I could beat sitting duck and the interactive bot.

(5/29/24):
I worked on implementing more methods into my code since I didn't have any and I added one that would make it move away from the wall when it hit the wall and made it fire twice when it scanned a robot. I commited the change as "Final Draft" but for some reason it didn't save. I could beat crazy, but I couldn't beat more stationary bots like corners. Also I think Chaos bot is a funny name and I made the gun pink. 

(5/29/24) (later):
At home I worked on it again and I added a method to make it move out of the way after being hit by a bulllet. I also made it move away in a random direction when it hit a wall. I committed these changes as "Final Draft 2.0" and I like where my robot is now and I really like my strategy so I will submit it.
